### Switching Gears

You may not be surprised when I say that I'm taking a break from learning Reactive Cocoa. Several of my coworkers are diving into swift, and with the imminent release of Reactive Cocoa 3.0, I decided to switch gears.

<!-- more -->

I'm going to recreate this app entirely in swift from the ground up. My hope is that after the project releases, then I can transition back to Reactive Cocoa using the newer version in swift.

I think it's a wiser decision overall, given how I'll need to learn swift eventually. Reactive cocoa is transitioning over, so it just makes sense for me to transition over as well. Once I feel efficient enough, then I can pick up Reactive Cocoa once more.
