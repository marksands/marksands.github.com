Some friends and I have started up a new podcast at Effective Programming. We're a group of iOS developers who love exploring the platform, new technical challenges, agile software development, and the latest trend in test driven development[ยน](http://podcast.effectiveprogramming.com).

#### Episode 1 - TDD in the Balance

Episode 1 was a healthy discussion of the pros and cons of [TDD](http://podcast.effectiveprogramming.com/2014/05/15/tdd-in-the-balance.html).

#### Episode 2 - iOS Eventing Frameworks

Episode 2 was about [iOS communication patterns](http://podcast.effectiveprogramming.com/2014/05/19/ios-eventing-frameworks.html) where we discussed 6 techniques of eventing in iOS while following along with a [project](https://github.com/marksands/CommunicationPatterns) that I wrote to heed the discussion.

We would love it if you would check us out, [subscribe on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/effective-programming-podcast), and give us a rating! Let us know what you think on twitter at [@effprog](http://www.twitter.com/effprog)!
