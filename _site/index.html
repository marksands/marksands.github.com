            <p>As every iOS developer knows, Apple can do whatever they want with their own native apps, meaning they can and do use private APIs. It&#39;s not too surprising, after all, it is their domain and they are in control. However, Apple&#39;s overuse of private APIs can make third-party apps second-class citizens; iBooks is notorious of such private API abuse<a href="http://www.marco.org/2010/04/06/ibooks-and-private-apis">¹</a>.</p>

<h3>UIPopoverController on the iPhone</h3>

<p>One UIKit component iBooks uses is UIPopoverController. This is frustrating because UIPopoverController is reservered for iPad development only. So how does iBooks implement an iPod/iPhone compatible UIPopoverController? I <a href="http://marksands.github.io/2014/01/03/inspecting-third-party-apps.html">inspected</a> iBooks on a jailbroken iPod touch to verify that the popover was in fact the UIPopoverController class and not a cheap replacement. To be sure I wasn&#39;t crazy, I created a new iOS project targeted for iPhone and spun up a quick <code>UIPopoverController</code> Hello World app. Sure enough, it crashed <code>-[UIPopoverController initWithContentViewController:] called when not running under UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad.</code> If this is true, then how on earth is Apple getting around this?</p>

<h3>The Secret Sauce</h3>

<p>In order to find out Apple&#39;s secret sauce, I opened <a href="http://www.hopperapp.com/">Hopper</a> to dig a little deeper. Here&#39;s sort of what Apple&#39;s code <s>may look like</s> looks like under the covers when creating a UIPopoverController.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="objective-c"><span class="lineno"> 1</span> <span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">id</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">initWithContentViewController:</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">UIViewController</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">viewController</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="lineno"> 3</span>      <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">([[</span><span class="n">UIDevice</span> <span class="n">currentDevice</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">userInterfaceIdiom</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="lineno"> 4</span>          <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">([</span><span class="n">UIPopoverController</span> <span class="n">_popoversDisabled</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="lineno"> 5</span>              <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSException</span> <span class="n">raise</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">NSInvalidArgumentException</span> <span class="n">format</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;-[UIPopoverController initWithContentViewController:] called when not running under UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad.&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="lineno"> 6</span>          <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="lineno"> 7</span>      <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="lineno"> 8</span>  <span class="p">}</span>    
<span class="lineno"> 9</span>  <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="lineno">10</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see, they are definitely checking to make sure the current device is an iPad, otherwise it will raise an exception. But wait, what&#39;s this private class method <code>_popoversDisabled</code>? Let&#39;s open that up to find out.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="objective-c"><span class="lineno">1</span> <span class="k">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">BOOL</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">_popoversDisabled</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="lineno">5</span>       <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">NO</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="lineno">6</span>   <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="lineno">7</span>   <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">YES</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="lineno">8</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Say what?! Did Apple seriously grant access to four of their native apps by hardcoding their bundle identifiers? Yep, they sure did².</p>

<p>In fact, you don&#39;t have to do anything special to verify this. If you change your <code>UIPopoverController</code> Hello World project&#39;s Info.plist bundle identifier to <code>com.apple.iBooks</code> or <code>com.apple.itunesu</code>, then voilà, It works!</p>

<h3>What now?</h3>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to see how Apple bends the rules for their benefit, but I think there is something more telling here. The fact of the matter is, <code>UIPopoverController</code> works on the iPhone and iPod touch out of the box. Apple simply has it locked down for now. Will iOS 8 finally bring <code>UIPopoverController</code> support to the iPhone and iPod touch? One can hope! At least we only have to wait until next week to find out.</p>

            <h3>Black and White</h3>

<p>When writing unit tests using mocks, it forces the developer into whitebox testing. As the tests are supposed to drive the design, one can argue that this allows them to define the dependencies of the business logic in which they are writing the tests. The quandary, though, is that these tests are no longer unit tests as there is a discrepancy between a single unit and a system of functions that interact with many units or dependencies. Furthermore, tests that rely heavily upon mocks wind up with a test suite that has mocks mocking mocks mocking mocks and so forth, which can lead to a broken test suite any time a programmer tries to refactor in, or out, another dependency.</p>

<p>On the other hand, blackbox testing provides a much better hands off approach to implementation details, namely dependencies. In DI heavy software architecture, blockbox testing tends to be difficult without having the ability to mock and stub internal details. If you only rely on the Given-When-Then formula, then tests should only be concerned with input and output. Stated another way, mocks, expects, and verifies should be replaced with independent objects and assertions. Gary Bernhardt articulates this better than I can in his talk Boundaries.¹</p>

<h3>Dependencies and Decisions</h3>

<p>When many dependencies, or units, are involved in a path or decision then you should write an integration test instead of mocking out dependencies for an &quot;isolated&quot; unit test. The only time this becomes painful is when multiple decisions in a path directly rely on multiple dependencies; this tends to reek of a code smell. One solution is to split dependencies and decisions into separate layers. Gary&#39;s talk above calls this the functional core and the imperative shell. In the imperative shell, many dependencies work together to formulate a single path with zero conditionals and decisions, while the decisions are deferred to each individual unit formulating the functional core. This makes the majority of testing pains go away.</p>

<p>The functional core can be fully unit tested with every decision having a test. And instead of unit testing the imperative shell, a single integration test will suffice for each component. The rules I follow are: when you find yourself testing a component with many dependencies, don&#39;t use mocks; instead, write an integration test. Refactor until most, if not all, decisions are deferred to each dependency and drive out the implementation using TDD.</p>

<h3>A Rant</h3>

<p>This approach confirms most of my suspicions about using mocks in testing. Mocking (done wrong, and it is often done wrong) is tautological. I&#39;ve both written code and I&#39;ve seen code that mocks a dependency, stubs a method to return a result, and verifies that the method was called and the result was the expected output. I&#39;ve never appreciated this style and it usually feels as though I&#39;m ticking a box off of the test code coverage list. I remain unconvinced that this provides any benefits in opposition to an integration test.</p>

<p>With a test suite that reflects the style of mocks mocking mocks mocking mocks, refactoring can be a major testing pain. If you modify, add, or remove a dependency, chances are a lot of the mocks and method stubs in your tests will no longer be valid. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if such a simple change broke an entire test class littered with mocks.</p>

<h3>A Resolution</h3>

<p>1 Corinthians 1:13 says, &quot;When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.&quot; Fortunately, I have put aside my days of mocking. I have felt the pains and drawn my losses, choosing to revisit testing and figure out how to fix the problem. I have been experimenting with a side project attempting to separate the functional core from the imperative shell. It is not easy to remove every conditional from the shell, but it has definitely been a relief for testing. And now that my unit tests only use real objects and assertions, I no longer have to choose between which testing and mocking framework to include in my project. I would encourage you to try this approach and see for yourself if it changes the way you test your code.</p>

            <h3>An Alternative Approach</h3>

<p>This post is an overview of an alternative approach to attaching <a href="http://revealapp.com/">Reveal</a> or <a href="http://www.sparkinspector.com/">Spark</a> to third party apps on a jailbroken device. Peter Steinberger posted a <a href="http://petersteinberger.com/blog/2013/how-to-inspect-the-view-hierarchy-of-3rd-party-apps/">blog post</a> demonstrating how this works using MobileSubstrate. Unfortunately, this approach didn&#39;t work for me and a few others that shared my woes via Twitter.</p>

<p>As Peter said in his blog post, the iOS7 jailbreak will allow us to attach the debugger to 3rd party apps in order to study the view heirarchy of complex apps. This will provide developers with insight to how others have approached similar problems.<a href="http://petersteinberger.com/blog/2013/how-to-inspect-the-view-hierarchy-of-3rd-party-apps/">¹</a></p>

<h3>Jailbreak + Setup</h3>

<p>Although Peter&#39;s post can get you 90% of the way, I&#39;ll reiterate his steps here to save you an extra tab in your browser.</p>

<ol>
<li>I jailbroke my iPad 3 using the 1.0.1 version of <a href="http://evasi0n.com/">evasi0n&#39;s app</a>.</li>
<li>Be sure to install OpenSSH. Once installed, make sure you can ssh into your device via <code>ssh root@192.168.1.102</code> using the default password <code>alpine</code>. Obviously you should replace this example IP address with your device&#39;s wifi address.</li>
<li>Next, we&#39;ll copy our libReveal.dlylib and our libSpark.dlyib files onto our device. It doesn&#39;t really matter where the files are copied to on the device, but since I started down the path of using MobileSubstrate, I ended up copying both files to its DynamicLibraries directory: <code>scp /Applications/Reveal.app/Contents/SharedSupport/iOS-Libraries/libReveal.dylib root@192.168.1.102:/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries</code> and <code>scp &quot;/Applications/Spark Inspector.app/Contents/Resources/Frameworks/SparkInspector.dylib&quot; root@192.168.1.102:/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Beyond this, if Mobile Substrate works for you, then there is no need to go any further. But for the rest of us, we&#39;ll have to resort to other options.</p>

<h3>DYLD FTW</h3>

<p>Thankfully, it is possible to perform code injection using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man1/dyld.1.html">dynamic linker</a>. Using the environment variable <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code>, we can inject Reveal and/or Spark into 3rd party applications on the device. According to the man page, this environment variable is:<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man1/dyld.1.html">²</a></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES
    This  is  a colon separated list of dynamic libraries to load before the ones specified in the
    program.  This lets you test new modules of existing dynamic shared libraries that are used in
    flat-namespace images by loading a temporary dynamic shared library with just the new modules.
    Note that this has no effect on images built a two-level  namespace  images  using  a  dynamic
    shared library unless DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE is also used.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Knowing this, all we need to do is set the environment variable to our dylib path and we will be good to go. To inject Reveal, copy this into your ssh terminal.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">launchctl setenv DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES /Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/libReveal.dylib
launchctl setenv DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE &#39;&#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>As of this post, Reveal is having trouble attaching to and inspecting Springboard. Thankfully, Spark Inspector is able to take on the load of Springboard, so if you wish to inject both libraries, you can also do that by using a colon separated list of libraries.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">launchctl setenv DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES /Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/libReveal.dylib:/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/SparkInspector.dylib
launchctl setenv DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE &#39;&#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once you have this set, that&#39;s really all you need to do. Launch an app to get started. If you want to inspect Springboard you&#39;ll have to restart the device first. I use <code>sbreload</code> from the UIKitTools Cydia package, but <code>killall SpringBoard</code> should work too.</p>

<p>The good thing about this approach is that it doesn&#39;t require MobileSubstrate and it works on ARM and ARM64, as <a href="https://twitter.com/hjaltij/status/419154290453008384">verified</a> via Twitter.</p>
