            <h3>Black and White</h3>

<p>When writing unit tests using mocks, it forces the developer into whitebox testing. As the tests are supposed to drive the design, one can argue that this allows them to define the dependencies of the business logic in which they are writing the tests. The quandary, though, is that these tests are no longer unit tests as there is a discrepancy between a single unit and a system of functions that interact with many units or dependencies. Furthermore, tests that rely heavily upon mocks wind up with a test suite that has mocks mocking mocks mocking mocks and so forth, which can lead to a broken test suite any time a programmer tries to refactor in, or out, another dependency.</p>

<p>On the other hand, blackbox testing provides a much better hands off approach to implementation details, namely dependencies. In DI heavy software architecture, blockbox testing tends to be difficult without having the ability to mock and stub internal details. If you only rely on the Given-When-Then formula, then tests should only be concerned with input and output. Stated another way, mocks, expects, and verifies should be replaced with independent objects and assertions. Gary Bernhardt articulates this better than I can in his talk Boundaries.¹</p>

<h3>Dependencies and Decisions</h3>

<p>When many dependencies, or units, are involved in a path or decision then you should write an integration test instead of mocking out dependencies for an &quot;isolated&quot; unit test. The only time this becomes painful is when multiple decisions in a path directly rely on multiple dependencies; this tends to reek of a code smell. One solution is to split dependencies and decisions into separate layers. Gary&#39;s talk above calls this the functional core and the imperative shell. In the imperative shell, many dependencies work together to formulate a single path with zero conditionals and decisions, while the decisions are deferred to each individual unit formulating the functional core. This makes the majority of testing pains go away.</p>

<p>The functional core can be fully unit tested with every decision having a test. And instead of unit testing the imperative shell, a single integration test will suffice for each component. The rules I follow are: when you find yourself testing a component with many dependencies, don&#39;t use mocks; instead, write an integration test. Refactor until most, if not all, decisions are deferred to each dependency and drive out the implementation using TDD.</p>

<h3>A Rant</h3>

<p>This approach confirms most of my suspicions about using mocks in testing. Mocking (done wrong, and it is often done wrong) is tautological. I&#39;ve both written code and I&#39;ve seen code that mocks a dependency, stubs a method to return a result, and verifies that the method was called and the result was the expected output. I&#39;ve never appreciated this style and it usually feels as though I&#39;m ticking a box off of the test code coverage list. I remain unconvinced that this provides any benefits in opposition to an integration test.</p>

<p>With a test suite that reflects the style of mocks mocking mocks mocking mocks, refactoring can be a major testing pain. If you modify, add, or remove a dependency, chances are a lot of the mocks and method stubs in your tests will no longer be valid. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if such a simple change broke an entire test class littered with mocks.</p>

<h3>A Resolution</h3>

<p>1 Corinthians 1:13 says, &quot;When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.&quot; Fortunately, I have put aside my days of mocking. I have felt the pains and drawn my losses, choosing to revisit testing and figure out how to fix the problem. I have been experimenting with a side project attempting to separate the functional core from the imperative shell. It is not easy to remove every conditional from the shell, but it has definitely been a relief for testing. And now that my unit tests only use real objects and assertions, I no longer have to choose between which testing and mocking framework to include in my project. I would encourage you to try this approach and see for yourself if it changes the way you test your code.</p>

            <h3>An Alternative Approach</h3>

<p>This post is an overview of an alternative approach to attaching <a href="http://revealapp.com/">Reveal</a> or <a href="http://www.sparkinspector.com/">Spark</a> to third party apps on a jailbroken device. Peter Steinberger posted a <a href="http://petersteinberger.com/blog/2013/how-to-inspect-the-view-hierarchy-of-3rd-party-apps/">blog post</a> demonstrating how this works using MobileSubstrate. Unfortunately, this approach didn&#39;t work for me and a few others that shared my woes via Twitter.</p>

<p>As Peter said in his blog post, the iOS7 jailbreak will allow us to attach the debugger to 3rd party apps in order to study the view heirarchy of complex apps. This will provide developers with insight to how others have approached similar problems.<a href="http://petersteinberger.com/blog/2013/how-to-inspect-the-view-hierarchy-of-3rd-party-apps/">¹</a></p>

<h3>Jailbreak + Setup</h3>

<p>Although Peter&#39;s post can get you 90% of the way, I&#39;ll reiterate his steps here to save you an extra tab in your browser.</p>

<ol>
<li>I jailbroke my iPad 3 using the 1.0.1 version of <a href="http://evasi0n.com/">evasi0n&#39;s app</a>.</li>
<li>Be sure to install OpenSSH. Once installed, make sure you can ssh into your device via <code>ssh root@192.168.1.102</code> using the default password <code>alpine</code>. Obviously you should replace this example IP address with your device&#39;s wifi address.</li>
<li>Next, we&#39;ll copy our libReveal.dlylib and our libSpark.dlyib files onto our device. It doesn&#39;t really matter where the files are copied to on the device, but since I started down the path of using MobileSubstrate, I ended up copying both files to its DynamicLibraries directory: <code>scp /Applications/Reveal.app/Contents/SharedSupport/iOS-Libraries/libReveal.dylib root@192.168.1.102:/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries</code> and <code>scp &quot;/Applications/Spark Inspector.app/Contents/Resources/Frameworks/SparkInspector.dylib&quot; root@192.168.1.102:/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Beyond this, if Mobile Substrate works for you, then there is no need to go any further. But for the rest of us, we&#39;ll have to resort to other options.</p>

<h3>DYLD FTW</h3>

<p>Thankfully, it is possible to perform code injection using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man1/dyld.1.html">dynamic linker</a>. Using the environment variable <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code>, we can inject Reveal and/or Spark into 3rd party applications on the device. According to the man page, this environment variable is:<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man1/dyld.1.html">²</a></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES
    This  is  a colon separated list of dynamic libraries to load before the ones specified in the
    program.  This lets you test new modules of existing dynamic shared libraries that are used in
    flat-namespace images by loading a temporary dynamic shared library with just the new modules.
    Note that this has no effect on images built a two-level  namespace  images  using  a  dynamic
    shared library unless DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE is also used.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Knowing this, all we need to do is set the environment variable to our dylib path and we will be good to go. To inject Reveal, copy this into your ssh terminal.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">launchctl setenv DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES /Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/libReveal.dylib
launchctl setenv DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE &#39;&#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>As of this post, Reveal is having trouble attaching to and inspecting Springboard. Thankfully, Spark Inspector is able to take on the load of Springboard, so if you wish to inject both libraries, you can also do that by using a colon separated list of libraries.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">launchctl setenv DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES /Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/libReveal.dylib:/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/SparkInspector.dylib
launchctl setenv DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE &#39;&#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once you have this set, that&#39;s really all you need to do. Launch an app to get started. If you want to inspect Springboard you&#39;ll have to restart the device first. I use <code>sbreload</code> from the UIKitTools Cydia package, but <code>killall SpringBoard</code> should work too.</p>

<p>The good thing about this approach is that it doesn&#39;t require MobileSubstrate and it works on ARM and ARM64, as <a href="https://twitter.com/hjaltij/status/419154290453008384">verified</a> via Twitter.</p>

            <h3>UIColor</h3>

<p><code>UIColor</code> is a commonly used class that represents color and sometimes opacity. As it turns out, <code>UIColor</code> is a class cluster made up of a couple of private concrete subclasses. 
Class clusters group a number of private concrete subclasses under a public abstract superclass; this is based on the abstract factory design pattern.<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/CocoaObjects/CocoaObjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH4-SW34">¹</a></p>

<h3>Red, Green, Blue</h3>

<p>As of iOS 6, subclasses of the <code>UIColor</code> class cluster include <a href="https://github.com/nst/iOS-Runtime-Headers/blob/master/Frameworks/UIKit.framework/UIDeviceWhiteColor.h"><code>UIDeviceWhiteColor</code></a> 
and <a href="https://github.com/nst/iOS-Runtime-Headers/blob/master/Frameworks/UIKit.framework/UIDeviceRGBColor.h"><code>UIDeviceRGBColor</code></a>. 
Unfortunately for the programmer, only <code>UIDeviceRGBColor</code> knows what red, green, and blue are, making it challenging to get the color components from a generic <code>UIColor</code> object.</p>

<p>According to Apple, <code>UIColor</code>&#39;s method <code>getRed:green:blue:alpha:</code> will return the red, green, and blue color components if the color is within the RGB color space. 
If the color is in a compatible color space, the color is converted into RGB format and its components are returned to your application. 
If the color is not in a compatible color space, the parameters are unchanged.<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIColor_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIColor/getRed:green:blue:alpha:">²</a> 
And therein lies the problem.</p>

<p>Say we have an API that accepts a <code>UIColor</code> object and uses its color components for some arbitrary computation. One might think, &quot;<code>getRed:green:blue:alpha</code> to the rescue!&quot; 
Sadly, this bruteforce approach will only work if the <code>UIColor</code> object is of the RGB color space, or the <code>UIDeviceRGBColor</code> class. The only approach is to inspect and retreive 
the color components using the Core Graphics functions <code>CGColorGetNumberOfComponents(color.CGColor)</code> and <code>CGColorGetComponents(color.CGColor)</code>. This approach quickly doesn&#39;t scale if you 
are constantly retreiving the color components for various reasons, so it would be ideal if <code>UIColor</code> handled this for us under the hood. For the curious, I have 
<a href="http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=3114410">created a radar</a> in hopes to address this issue.</p>

<h3>A Universal Selector</h3>

<p>Luckily for us, we have <em>objc/funtime.h</em> that will provide exactly what we want. Using method swizzling, we can create an alternative to <code>getRed:green:blue:alpha</code> that 
checks the number of the color components using <code>getRed:green:blue:alpha</code> for <code>UIDeviceRGBColor</code> objects and <code>getWhite:alpha</code> for <code>UIDeviceWhiteColor</code> objects. The color 
components from <code>UIDeviceWhiteColor</code> objects are calculated by using the white balance as a multiplier for each RGB component. Using this approach, we have successfully 
moved the redundant color space checking behind the scenes and provided ourselves with much cleaner code snippets. The category implementation is below.</p>

            <h3>Trampolines</h3>

<p>A trampoline is a small piece of code that is created at run time when the address of a nested function is taken. 
It normally resides on the stack, in the stack frame of the containing function. The word trampoline is used because execution jumps 
into the trampoline object and then immediately jumps out.<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Trampolines.html">¹</a></p>

<p>A trampoline object in Objective-C is a subclass of <code>NSProxy</code> that is returned by a method and acts like a delegate by forwarding messages to another object. 
This brings us to higher order messaging.</p>

<h3>Higher Order Messaging</h3>

<p>Higher order messaging allows messages that have messages as arguments. This is analogous to languages that treat functions as a first-class data type, 
like Lisp, Haskell, and PHP do. Even C and its descendants can use function pointers, although it&#39;s not as pretty. Objective-C is a perfect candidate for 
higher order messaging, or HOM, since the language is known for its message passing traits.<a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/07/16/hom.html?page=last&amp;x-order=date">²</a></p>

<p>The code for a trampoline object is quite trivial. The implementation below is specialized for an <code>NSArray</code> and assumes ARC is enabled. The <code>#pragma</code> cruff 
is necessary to silence warnings.</p>

<p>This is the basic implementation for a trampoline object. For our intents and purposes, we will be using it to create a category on <code>NSArray</code> to add a <code>collect</code> method. You might see some 
programmers use <code>do</code> as their method name of choice, but since <code>do</code> is a keyword, I will avoid that route.</p>

<p>Here, our <code>NSArray</code> category implements a public <code>collect</code> method that will return our trampoline object to bounce the method argument to the private <code>collect:</code> method 
that uses the forwarded <code>NSInvocation</code> to assist with the bouncing.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all there is to it. This might look more complicated than necessary to accomplish iteration, but benefits do exist. Having a one-off solution is 
good for writing this once and only once, which can also provide assurance of getting rid of one-off errors, and loops are optimized more easily when they are
internalized in this manner.</p>

<p>There are many more uses for HOM than iteration, but methods such as <code>collect</code> seem to be the most commonly used higher-order methods. Another use 
case could be a protocol checker to act as a proxy for an object and only pass messages through that are part of a given protocol, but the possibilities are, 
of course, endless.<a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/07/16/hom.html?page=last&amp;x-order=date">²</a></p>
