        <p>The functional reactive programming trend is at an all time high. With the advances of Swift, ReactiveCocoa recently shipped version 4.0 and RxSwift turned 1 year old a few days ago. Back in the days of <del>old</del> Objective-C, I gave <a href="http://marksands.github.io/2014/12/30/reacting-to-reactive-cocoa-part-i.html">Reactive Cocoa a shot</a>, but I ultimately gave up.<a href="http://marksands.github.io/2014/12/30/reacting-to-reactive-cocoa-part-i.html">¹</a></p>

<p>Since then, I’ve reclaimed my lost courage and have tackled both ReactiveCocoa and RxSwift head on. I’m currently sticking with RxSwift for now, with the main advantage being that Rx is a cross language API. This makes it helpful when doing cross functional pairing between Android and iOS development.</p>

<p>In any case, my coworker and I wrote a blog post on our company website detailing the architectural pattern we use to develop apps in a reactive manner. Here’s a link to the post <a href="http://blog.asynchrony.com/2016/02/model-view-binding-swift/">http://blog.asynchrony.com/2016/02/model-view-binding-swift/</a> or continue reading for the full article.<a href="http://blog.asynchrony.com/2016/02/model-view-binding-swift/">²</a></p>

<h3 id="apples-best-practices">Apple’s Best Practices</h3>

<p>When Apple publishes sample code, they have to cater to their audience. They can’t expect to publish sample code that only 1% of readers can immediately take it and roll with it. Intead they employ a common publishing tactic known as lowering literacy to minister to a broader audience. In this manner, Apple’s sample code won’t be glistening with SOLID design or highly composable elements but instead will be a popular, actionable source for most developers.</p>

<p>The following is a synopsis of a crash that stumped my team for several days, and the process we took to investigate such bizarre behavior and ultimately diagnose and fix the problem. I’ll go over how we arrived at our solution and the debugging steps we took to get there. Hopefully by the end of the story you’ll have learned something along the way.</p>

<p>You may not be surprised when I say that I’m taking a break from learning Reactive Cocoa. Several of my coworkers are diving into swift, and with the imminent release of Reactive Cocoa 3.0, I decided to switch gears.</p>

        <h3 id="asynchronously-loading-images">Asynchronously Loading Images</h3>

<p>One of my first endevours into the realm of expanding my <code class="highlighter-rouge">RACObserve</code>-fu was to asynchronously load a <code class="highlighter-rouge">UIImage</code> from an image URL that was returned from the movie API in order to populate thumbnails in table view cells. Historically, using <code class="highlighter-rouge">AFNetworking</code>’s built-in mechanism or a third party caching library such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">SDWebImage</code> would work perfectly fine, but I wanted to stick to my guns and fully gulp the Reactive Cocoa punch that I’ve so graciously poured.</p>
